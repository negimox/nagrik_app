# Google Gemini AI Integration Bug Fix

## Issue Fixed

The image detection component was failing with the error:

```
Error detecting objects in image: TypeError: model.generateContent is not a function
```

## Root Cause

The issue was related to how the Gemini AI API was being called. In the `genai-utils.ts` file, we were incorrectly trying to access the `generateContent` method on a model object instead of using the API correctly according to the `@google/genai` package's expectations.

## Fix Details

Based on how the API is correctly used in `Prompt.tsx`, we made the following changes:

1. Modified how we call the Gemini API:

   - Use `genAI.models.generateContent()` directly with a model string parameter
   - Properly structure the request with the correct parameters

2. Added better error handling:
   - Made the response text handling more robust with null checks
   - Added logging to help diagnose any future issues

## Testing

To test the fixed functionality:

1. Navigate to `/citizen/image-detection-demo`
2. Upload an image or take a photo with the camera
3. Check the browser console for any errors
4. Verify that objects are being detected correctly

## Implementation Notes

- The implementation now closely mirrors the approach used in `Prompt.tsx`
- We're using the "models/gemini-2.0-flash" model for image detection
- Added console logging for debugging purposes that can be removed for production

## API Keys

Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly in your `.env.local` file.
