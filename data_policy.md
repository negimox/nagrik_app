# Some upcoming challenges

- First, 70% of the global population will be living in urban centres, some in cities of more than 100 million people, infrastructure will determine their quality of life.
- Second, the vital challenge of fresh water. Already, 20% of the population lacks clean drinking water and 40% lacks basic sanitation. As this global divide becomes even more acute, it will drive radical changes in awareness and behaviour around water usage and management, and the energy intensity of our consumption. Infrastructure is vital in addressing this challenge.
- Third, the second great challenge relates to energy. As more people demand greater levels of energy to fuel consumption, there are challenges of supply, sufficiency and sustainability. Infrastructure must support this growth, but should do so responsibly.
- Fourth, the great challenge relates to social infrastructure and the question of how we – collectively and as individuals – will finance the cost of more people living longer and having fewer children.

# Some Complexities in 2050

Complexities of infrastructure development need to be understood in order that the supporting frameworks are sensitive to these needs:

- Lack of infrastructure is the primary growth constraint
- Lead times associated with infrastructure development mean that decisions taken now will shape the world of the future
- Increasingly, therefore, government looks to the private sector as a partner. However, effective models for co-working between the public and private sectors need to be devised.
- Governments and businesses must make vital strategic decisions now, and promote changes in behavior, before the speed and severity of climate change are fully known
- An increase in natural disasters or unpredictable events will test the resilience of infrastructure, not just in terms of reconstruction, but also in terms of supply chain disruptions
- New technologies, like high-speed broadband, are already part of infrastructure thinking. Innovations, such as Internet of Things, will make infrastructure more efficient and sustainable

# India - Growth and Infrastructure

Infrastructure is an enabler for growth. We expect India’s GDP to recover in the five years beginning fiscal 2021 (2020-21 to 2024-25). The growth will be supported by the following factors:

- With the clean-up of financial sector balance sheets, banks and financial institutions will be in a much better position to provide credit
- With the end of deleveraging phase, the corporates will start leveraging and this will push growth up. The corporate tax cut is allowing the companies to de-leverage faster and they will be primed up for undertaking investments when the economic cycle turns
- Payoff from reforms like Goods and Services Tax and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 are work in progress and once streamlined they will create possibility of an ‘efficiency-led’ spurt of growth over the medium run
- Capacity utilisation will catch up and result in an improvement in the investment cycle
- Infrastructure thrust by the Government of India through creating the NIP

# Infrastructure development critical for boosting growth

at an annual rate of 2.4%. By 2030, it is estimated that around 42% of India’s population would be urbanised from 31% in 2011. Refer Figure 3 below.

For faster growth to meet the target of $ 5 trillion economy by 2025, more supply-side reforms are needed. Creating new and upgrading existing infrastructure will be key to raising India’s competitiveness and achieving this target. It will specially be critical for the success of the Make in India programme as manufacturing competitiveness critically depends on infrastructure. The supply additions through infrastructure development boost short-term as well as the potential rate of GDP growth. Infrastructure creation is also labour absorbing, which boosts employment and income generation in the economy and further spurs domestic demand. Improved infrastructure capacities also create efficiency gains through improved logistics and networks, which would improve the competitiveness of the economy. This can help kick in a virtuous cycle of higher investments, growth and employment generation in the economy.

# India 2030: Demographic Changes and Infrastructure Needs

Economic growth will be accompanied by shift in the underlying demographics. There will be an increasing trend of urbanisation, a peaking of the population in the working-age group, and a larger share of this population will be employed in the services sector. By 2030, it is estimated that five states in India – Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Punjab will have more than 50% urbanisation. Also, the number of metropolitan cities in India are estimated to increase from 46 as per Census 2011 to 68 in 2030.

# Increasing urbanisation

As per World Bank data, India’s population has increased at a CAGR of 1.2% during the period 2011-2017 and is expected to reach 1.52 billion by 2030. In the last decade, the urban population in India has increased.

Plugging the deficiency in infrastructure will smoothen the process of urbanisation by promoting ease of living and facilitating economic activity. It will thus help in realising the full potential of a growing urban economy and raise its contribution to GDP.

As per the National Sample Survey Office survey conducted in 2011-12, India had a total workforce of 0.47 billion, out of which, 0.34 billion are employed in the rural areas and 0.14 billion are employed in urban areas. Figure 5 shows the contribution of urban and rural areas to total employment in India.

# Figure 5 Contribution of urban and rural areas to total employment in India

| Employment share (%) | 0.47 bn | 0.64 bn |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| 100%                 | 29%     | 41%     |
| 0%                   | 71%     | 59%     |

Working-age population is defined as the number of people in the age bracket 15 to 64 and is considered as a basic indicator for productive capacity. Figure 4 shows the expected growth in the working-age population of India as compared with other countries such as the US and China over the next few years.

It is estimated that India’s total workforce will reach 0.64 billion by 2030, out of which, 0.38 billion will be employed in the rural areas and 0.26 billion will be employed in the urban areas. Contribution of urban areas in total employment will increase at a higher rate than the contribution of rural areas during the period 2018-30. The proportion of urban areas in total employment will increase from 29% in 2012 to 41% in 2030, while that of the rural areas will decrease from 71% in 2012 to 59% in 2030.

By 2030, India will have a median age of 31 years versus China – 43 years and the US – 40 years. This will be an important growth booster.

As seen above in the share of sectors in overall employment in India, a similar trend is observed in the contribution of these sectors to the overall GDP of India. As of 2018, India’s GDP was $2.6 trillion with 54% share of services, 31% share of industry and 15% share of agriculture. By 2030, it is estimated that the share of services sector in India’s GDP will be 58%, the share of industry sector will be 34%, and the share of agriculture sector will decline to 8%.

It is estimated that the share of services in total employment in India will grow from 27% in 2012 to 48% in 2030, while that of agriculture will reduce from 49% in 2012 to 29% in 2030. The share of industry in total employment is expected to remain at ~24% during 2012-30. These trends are reflective of India’s economy gradually transitioning from an agrarian economy to a service-centric economy.

# Climate change and disaster resilience

Resilient infrastructure is critical for peoples’ well-being, quality of life, and economic prospects. It is as much about water-pipes withstanding an earthquake, as it is about people having adequate and safe access to their workplaces, schools and hospitals. At a macro level, physical infrastructure underpins the achievement of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). An estimated $94 trillion is expected to be invested in infrastructure globally in the next 25 years to sustain economic growth. Meanwhile, recent disasters indicate that up to 66% of total public sector losses in weather- and climate-related extreme events are related to infrastructure damage. There is a clear need for ensuring that all new and existing infrastructure systems are climate- and disaster-resilient.

# Infrastructure Vision and Goals

To achieve the target of $5 trillion economy by 2025, and meet the aspirations of the citizens of India, creating new and upgrading existing infrastructure will be the key to raising India’s competitiveness.

# Executive Summary

# Global trends in infrastructure spending

As per the Global Infrastructure Outlook 2017 published by Oxford Economics, the estimated global infrastructure investment requirement is $94 trillion during the period 2016 to 2040. Out of this envisaged infrastructure investment, ~50% is required in Asia alone (with China, India and Japan being major contributors), and with roads and electricity sub-sectors constituting ~67% of these investment needs. Another study has estimated that while the demand of infrastructure is growing at about $4 trillion per annum, the supply of infrastructure is growing at only $2.7 trillion annually, leading to a deficit of $1-1.5 trillion on a per annum basis.

It is estimated that India would need to spend $4.51 trillion on infrastructure by 2030 to realise the vision of a $5 trillion economy by 2025, and to continue on an escalated trajectory until 2030. The endeavor of the NIP would be to make this happen in an efficient manner.

# Importance of infrastructure sector given the transformation in India’s demographics

India’s GDP is expected to gradually move upwards in the five years starting from fiscal 2020 anchored on the clean-up of financial sector balance sheets, reversing the deleveraging phase with corporates starting to leverage for funding capex, leading to growth and payoff from policies and reforms such as Goods and Services Tax and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Capacity utilisation is expected to catch up, resulting in an improvement in the investment cycle. It is a given that infrastructure development is a critical factor for boosting the economy, providing improved growth prospects. In order to improve India’s global competitiveness, creating new and upgrading existing infrastructure will be critical along with introducing a slew of reforms. Infrastructure development is labour intensive, leading to increase in employment opportunities and thus, fueling domestic demand. All of this together can aid in initiating a virtuous cycle of higher investments, growth and employment generation in the economy.

The above envisaged economic growth will be accompanied by a shift in the underlying demographics of the country – increase in urbanisation levels, growing workable population and increase in the share of employed individuals in the services sector in urban areas. In the last decade, India’s urban population has increased at an annual rate of ~2.4%, which is expected to increase in the near future, given the focus on urban infrastructure and increase in employment opportunities in the urban areas. India’s urbanisation levels are estimated to improve to ~42% in 2030 from 34% as of 20182. These transformed demographics will require development of a host of infrastructure facilities, thus increasing the demand for increase in coverage and quality of service delivery across the entire infrastructure spectrum.

Overcoming the deficiencies in infrastructure and improving the quality of services provided in both urban and rural areas in India will help in realising full potential of the growing urban economy, thus raising its contribution to India’s GDP. Thus, focus on developing infrastructure

# Infrastructure Investment in India

Along with achieving SDGs and improving the living standards will lead to infrastructure investment in required areas such as redevelopment of slum neighbourhoods, urban roads, water supply coverage and quality, wastewater treatment facilities, and urban mobility through public transport. Further, in order to measure the standards of living, NITI Aayog has designed the ‘Ease of Living Index’ comprising of 37 measurable indicators, which take into consideration the UN 2030 SDGs. The indicators in the Ease of Living Index are categorised into – basic needs, welfare and human betterment. In order to meet growth aspirations and provide improved standard of living, the infrastructure investments need to focus on the above categories of the Ease of Living Index.

# Historical trend in infrastructure investment in India

Infrastructure investment in India during fiscals 2008 to 2017 was estimated at ~Rs 60 lakh crore ($1.1 trillion at average exchange rates of respective years). The infrastructure investment in the 11th Five Year Plan (fiscals 2008 to 2012) amounted to Rs 24 lakh crore and that in the 12th Five Year Plan (fiscals 2013 to 2017) amounted to Rs 36 lakh crore at current prices. However, infrastructure in GDP terms fell to ~5.8% during the 12th Five Year Plan from ~7% during the 11th five-year plan. As per estimates, India’s infrastructure investment for fiscals 2018 and 2019 are ~Rs 10.2 lakh crore and ~Rs 10 lakh crore respectively.

During the above period, infrastructure investment was predominantly made by the public sector (i.e. Centre and state governments with a share of ~70%), while the share of private sector was ~30% (the share of private sector during last two years was ~25%). The trend in India’s infrastructure investment since fiscal 2013 is highlighted in Figure 7.

Power, roads and bridges, urban, digital infrastructure and railways sub-sectors together constituted ~85% of the total infrastructure investment in India during fiscals 2013 to 2019. The Centre and states were the major funding sources for sectors such as power and roads and bridges, with moderate participation from the private sector. Digital sector investments were largely driven by the private sector, while investments in the irrigation sector were predominantly made by the state governments.

Quality of infrastructure is among the biggest hurdles facing the Indian government’s ambitious programme, called “Make in India,” which aims to improve the nation’s manufacturing capabilities and support higher growth for generating employment. The corporate growth and investments can also be hampered if the government fails to close the infrastructure deficit, which some experts estimate costs 4%-5% of GDP due to inefficiencies. Infrastructure development can not only help remove some of these inefficiencies contributing immediately to economic expansion, but also support stronger long-term growth.

India’s infrastructure bottleneck is a primary constraint to improving its global competitiveness, as measured by the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (Table 1).

# First pillar of Global Competitiveness Index – Institutions

As can be seen from Table 1 below on the first pillar:

- Focus will be given to quality of land administration (rank 112)
- On the legal framework for settling disputes (rank 53), lot of work has been done under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the Specific Relief Amendment Act, 2018. Work will be done this year to operationalise the special and designated courts for infrastructure disputes.
- On transparency (rank 66), significant work has been done by amendments to regulations and enforcement by regulatory bodies. More work will be done to enhance transparency.

The key benefits of the NIP to all stakeholders in India are outlined below in Figure 9.

# Figure 9 Key benefits of NIP

| Economy                                | Well-planned NIP will enable more infrastructure projects, power business, create jobs, improve ease of living, and provide equitable access to infrastructure for all, thereby making growth more inclusive.   |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Government                             | Well-developed infrastructure enhances level of economic activity, creates additional fiscal space by improving revenue base of the government, and ensures quality of expenditure focused on productive areas. |
| Developers                             | Provides better prepared projects, reduces aggressive bids/failure in project delivery, ensures enhanced access to sources of finance as a result of increased investor confidence.                             |
| Banks/financial institutions/investors | Builds investor confidence as identified projects are better prepared, exposures less likely to suffer stress given active project monitoring by competent authority, thereby ensuring better returns.          |

# Constituents of NIP

The NIP has been made on a best effort basis by aggregating the information provided by various stakeholders including line ministries, departments, state governments and private sector across infrastructure sub-sectors identified in the Harmonised Master List of Infrastructure.

To draw up the NIP, a bottom-up approach was adopted wherein all projects costing greater than Rs 100 crore per project under construction, proposed greenfield projects, brownfield projects and those at the conceptualisation stage were sought to be captured. The investment details of fiscal 2020 are estimates and those for fiscals 2021 to 2025 are projections.

---

The NIP could see more updates as some states are yet to share details. The implementation of projects included in NIP will depend on multiple factors such as clearances, timely approvals, and financing. The actual expenditure may vary from the estimates/projections and NIP shall be updated accordingly.

# Reforms

# General reforms

In order to scale up infrastructure investments in various sectors throughout the country, it is critical to introduce a set of general reforms and also update existing sectoral policies and reforms. This will aid in propelling investments in the infrastructure sector. Some of the key policies and reform initiatives to be undertaken are highlighted below.

# Improving project preparation processes

Project preparation processes such as planning and design are considered critical steps in creation and efficient implementation of bankable infrastructure projects. Inadequate attention to project planning may lead to avoidable delays in the implementation of the project or may even lead to scrapping of projects prior to its implementation. It is critical to have a robust project preparation framework consisting of:

- (i) transparent policy and legislative framework;
- (ii) presence of an overarching, capable and empowered public institution for infrastructure planning;
- (iii) presence of guidelines, national standards, model bidding documents and standard procedures, design considerations, including disaster resilience;
- (iv) well-defined workflows, proper appraisal, audits and approvals for quality assurance of project preparation documents; and
- (v) establishment of a project organisation or a special purpose vehicle (SPV) with such structure and capabilities.

# Enhancing execution capacity of private sector participants

For enabling robust private sector participation in the infrastructure sector, it is critical to have a deep pool of experienced developers with required competence and execution capacity. At present, in most of the infrastructure sectors in India, only a handful of strong private sector participants are available, reducing the pace of infrastructure build-out through PPP modes. To alleviate the lack of capacity for scheduled delivery of projects and development of a pool of private developers, it is necessary to have an effective enabling environment and capacity development of the private sector and the public sector as well. Collaborations and joint ventures with strong global infrastructure developers must be facilitated to build domestic capacity.

# Robust enabling environment

An effective enabling environment comprises a robust policy framework and well-developed public institutional capacity. This will help improve private sector participation through well-framed contractual agreements with optimal risk allocation and honouring of the contracts entered into. As a general principle, sanctity of contracts should be upheld both by the public and private sectors. Any issues related to contract deviation should be smoothly adjudicated through a dedicated dispute resolution mechanism in a timely manner by focusing on the following two elements:

1. Optimal risk sharing
   There should be optimal risk sharing between the public and private sector entities, and the risks should be allocated to parties that are best equipped to handle them. Further, delay in project clearances has been the most common reason for stalling of many infrastructure projects in India. Hence, a new mechanism needs to be established to ensure that all key clearances and approvals are in place upfront before awarding the project. Loading contracts with difficult conditions, both financial and non-financial, has led to unnecessary burden leading to financial stress and potential insolvency amongst developers. This must stop. Hence, the following are recommended:

- Adoption of international contract standards (such as FIDIC standards) by all infrastructure departments, including the Indian Railways, with clear procedures for change of scope, termination payments and safe exits for parties
- Project bidding and awards are to be done only after fulfilling requirements such as 90% of contiguous land acquisition and all clearances for the project

2. Sanctity and enforcement of contracts
   In order to boost private sector interest, it is critical that the sanctity of contracts is upheld by the Centre, state and local governments as well as the private sector. Provisions of contracts therein should be legally enforceable, which makes the parties involved legally abide by these contracts. In case of inability, there should be adequate safeguards built in the form of clearly quantified termination payments under various possible scenarios.

# Institutionalisation and efficiency of dispute resolution

A critical step in addressing dwindling private sector participation in infrastructure can be institutionalising dispute resolution mechanism to efficiently resolve disputes related to PPP projects. Adequate investments must be made in the institutions created under The Commercial Courts Act 2015, The Specific Relief (Amendment) Act 2018, and the New Delhi Arbitration Centre Act 2019, to enable them to deliver sound results in enabling speedy resolution in the next few years. The Task Force also recommends ministry level committees to resolve complex contractual disputes as mediation mechanisms that can settle disputes out of court.

---

# Improving capacity development of project execution agencies

The capacity of public institutions to plan, prepare and deliver infrastructure projects on schedule is key to effective infrastructure development. It is critical to undertake steps such as (i) establishing a robust project governance structure, (ii) use of agile planning, (iii) improving procurement process and strengthening contract management, (iv) strengthening people management processes in order to improve the project management capabilities of public institutions, and (v) provide flexibility to hire top talent at senior level including project leadership.

# Strengthening infrastructure quality

Good quality infrastructure is important for attaining faster economic growth, ensuring an improved human development index and broad-based participation in development with equitable distribution of benefits. Initiatives such as uniform regulation and output-based performance standards, consistent processes for updating/setting standards, improving compliance mechanism, alignment with development strategy, and alignment with social and environmental sustainability would help. A number of global benchmarks are available including the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment. The Task Force recommends that a National Framework for Infrastructure Quality must be laid down within the next three months, based on global and national standards.

# Promoting competition

In order to enhance competition in the domestic markets and to promote a culture of competition in the country, we need to establish an anti-trust resolution mechanism, improve collaboration between the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and sector regulators to address competition-related concerns and operationalisation of the National Competition Policy 2011. Ministries must build capacity and coordination mechanisms with market players and consumers to periodically assess the state of competition and put in place enabling conditions for growth of healthy competition.

# Financial sector reforms

In order to attract foreign and private capital into infrastructure, it is critical to undertake the following policies and reforms.

# Revitalising the bond and credit markets

Credit Enhancement Institution for infrastructure projects is expected to open up appetite of bond market investors for investing in infrastructure projects. Institutional investors are more suited to fund infrastructure projects given the long-term patient capital requirement of infrastructure projects. However, strict regulatory requirements require these investors to invest only in safe government and public sector bonds and they have limited appetite for lower-rated assets (below AA). As most of the infrastructure projects are rated below AA, it is critical to enhance their rating to augment the access of institutional investors to infrastructure sector through capital market instruments. A well-capitalised Credit Enhancement Institution should be set up early.

It is also important that long-term resources from the pension and insurance sectors are channelised into the infrastructure bond market; this may require the government to work with IRDA and PFRDA to re-examine existing investment guidelines. Further, growing the pool of pension and insurance assets through sector reforms is a pressing requirement, including potential FDI reforms.

Building up capacity of banking and financial institutions, including IIFCL and SBI, to provide long-term infrastructure finance is critical for growth of the sector. The Task Force also recommends suitable

# Governance Reforms in IIFCL

The possibility of regulatory reforms enabling IIFCL to be developed as a development finance institution (DFI) needs to be examined by the government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

# Strengthening the Municipal Bond Market in India

At present, grants from both state and central governments dominate the municipal financing landscape in India. These grants are substantially lower than the investment requirement of local governments. In order to augment their funding sources, it becomes critical that these local governments start tapping the bond markets. So far eight local bodies in India have raised Rs 3,390 crore via municipal bonds. By 2024, fifty cities are expected to issue municipal bonds. Given the governance and accounting reforms that municipalities need to undertake before they can inspire trust in the market, municipal bonds are a sure way to transform urban governance.

Key steps needed to be undertaken by the local government for raising funds through municipal bonds include:

1. Improving financial discipline and regular disclosures,
2. Augmenting revenue base and buoyancy of revenues of local governments,
3. Addressing gap in creditworthiness of local governments through innovative credit enhancement structures, and
4. Encouraging pooled bond issuances.

# Revitalising Asset Monetisation

Asset monetisation is considered critical for infrastructure sectors, as the asset-owning ministries, CPSEs and local bodies can reduce their debt burden by monetising their asset portfolio for further investment in creation of assets. The direct benefit of asset monetisation is that it creates an enabling environment for participation of long-term institutional investors and introduces private sector efficiencies in the management of infrastructure assets. The NHAI is amongst the first to monetise operational assets in the past four years.

Asset monetisation can be undertaken through:

- Sale of land,
- Non-operational assets through long-term lease with significant upfront lease payment,
- The toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model for operational road assets,
- Infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs),
- Sale of portfolio of assets to strategic/financial investors, and
- Loan asset monetisation through securitisation.

The first pipeline of assets to be monetised by March 2020 has been finalised and options such as TOT and InvITs have been initiated by the ministries of power, shipping, highways and railways. The Task Force recommends that the pipeline for the next two years also be finalised within the next three months.

Infrastructure Investment Trusts are a key way in which private developers could monetise their investments in infrastructure projects to enable them to raise cash for new project development. The Indian InvIT market is not yet mature and has supported formation of 10 InvITs till date, of which only two are listed. The leverage norms (debt to asset value) for InvITs have been recently relaxed to 70% from 49%. The Task Force recommends further facilitation and regulatory tweaks to enable InvITs to emerge as a crucial source of financing of public and private infrastructure, while making sure that there are adequate safeguards for double financing and ever-greening of loans.

# Enabling User Charges to Finance Infrastructure

It is critical to ensure appropriate pricing of infrastructure services, for the sponsors and investors of the infrastructure assets to recover both capital and operating costs. It is necessary to determine fair value of user charges to finance and grow infrastructure. Therefore, user charges policy framework will provide more clarity to investors and in turn improve their confidence. The Task Force recommends autonomous regulation of tariffs which, however, does not always translate into independent sectoral regulations. Other regulatory options like regulation by contract with price regulation provisions mentioned in the contract itself as well as multi-sectoral regulators may be actively considered. Multi-sectoral regulators (MSRs) may be

suitable as the objectives of regulation across infrastructure sectors are the same, while MSRs economise on skills and costs while addressing issues of regulatory capture.

# Long-term financing landscape

Necessary steps or initiatives need to be undertaken in order to solve the challenge of stressed assets faced by banks and infra-NBFCs besides liquidity crunch faced by NBFCs, by encouraging usage of innovative mechanisms such as loan securitisation, InvITs, etc and increased participation of Infrastructure debt funds (IDFs), DFIs, etc. The Task Force believes that deepening IDF markets and developing the asset-backed securitisation market for infrastructure could significantly relieve banks of current exposure in commissioned projects and enable them to direct more capital for greenfield projects. Taking note of the scarcity of long-term capital for infrastructure, the Task Force recommends regulatory revamp to enable significant participation of FPIs and FDI in IDFs, DFIs and securitisation markets in consultation with the RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Detailed reforms including those for each sector are enumerated in Volume II.

# Performance monitoring and evaluation

A monitoring and evaluation tool shall be used to help all stakeholders monitor the implementation and actual progress vis-à-vis initial estimates of the NIP for each of the infra sub-sectors. While basic monitoring will vest with the ministry and project agency, there is need for higher level of monitoring on reforms to be undertaken and to deal with issues of stalled project. The basic elements of the monitoring and evaluation framework are highlighted in table below. The recommended governance escalation matrix is provided in Annexure 2.
