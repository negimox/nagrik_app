# Introduction

Over the past decade, India has witnessed an unprecedented scale of infrastructure development, driven by a holistic and integrated approach. Anchored in key policy reforms and mission‑mode projects, this transformation has not only expanded physical connectivity but also elevated economic productivity, reduced logistics costs, and enhanced service delivery. Major national initiatives like PRAGATI, PM GatiShakti, the National Logistics Policy, Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN have collectively shaped the vision of a connected and competitive India. From record expansions in highways and expressways to electrification of railways, greenfield airports, ropeway connectivity in hilly terrains, and smart digital platforms, the infrastructure push reflects the government’s commitment to inclusive and sustainable development aligned with the goal of a Viksit Bharat by 2047.

# Institutional Reforms and Holistic Planning

# PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation)

Launched on March 25, 2015, PRAGATI is a transformative initiative aiming at strengthening governance and infrastructure development through the integration of cutting‑edge technology with administrative processes. The most recent, 46ᵗʰ PRAGATI meeting took place on April 30, 2025. During this session, the

# Prime Minister reviewed eight critical infrastructure projects valued at over ₹90,000 crore.

Since its launch, 363 projects have been reviewed under the PRAGATI initiative. PRAGATI enables the Prime Minister to directly engage with Secretaries of the Government of India and Chief Secretaries of the States via videoconferencing, supported by advanced digital data management and geo-spatial technologies. Its main objective is to create a culture of proactive governance and timely implementation of infrastructural projects by simultaneously addressing the grievances of citizens, ensuring the effective delivery of government programmes, and expediting critical projects that were previously delayed due to various inter-ministerial or federal issues.

# PM GatiShakti National Master Plan

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, launched on October 13, 2021, is a comprehensive initiative to improve multimodal infrastructure connectivity across India’s economic zones. Rs. 100 lakh crores are being efficiently utilized through this integrated platform. Anchored on seven key sectors—railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure—it promotes synchronized development across ministries and state governments. The plan uses a dynamic GIS platform developed by BISAG-N (Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics) for real-time project mapping and integration of over 200 data layers. This project has onboarded 44 Central Ministries and 36 States/UTs and a total of 1,614 data layers have also been integrated, by October 2024. A milestone of assessing 208 big-ticket infrastructure projects worth Rs. 15.39 lakh crores, of various Ministries adhering to PM Gati Shakti principles has been achieved.

PM GatiShakti will help in achieving the objective of an ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ by providing visibility to various stakeholders. Instead of planning &#x26; designing separately in silos, the projects will be designed and executed with a common vision. It will incorporate the infrastructure schemes of various Ministries and State Governments like Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, UDAN. Economic Zones like textile clusters, pharmaceutical clusters, defence corridors, electronic parks, industrial corridors, fishing clusters, agri zones etc. will be covered to improve connectivity &#x26; make Indian businesses more competitive. This will boost economic growth, attract foreign investments and enhance the country’s global competitiveness.

# National Logistics Policy

The National Logistics Policy (NLP) was launched on 17th September 2022 to boost India’s economic growth by creating an integrated, efficient, and cost-effective logistics network. The policy aims to reduce logistics costs, improve India's Logistics Performance Index (LPI) ranking to be among the top 25 countries by 2030, and promote data-driven decision-making. The policy aims to lower the cost of logistics from the existing 13-14% and lead it to par with other developed countries. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian products in both the Indian home market and the international market. Moreover, the reduced cost will also increase efficiency efforts cutting across all sectors of the economy, which encourages value addition and enterprise.

India’s ranking in World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) has improved by sixteen places from 54 (out of 160 countries) in 2014 to 38 (out of 139 countries) in 2023. The World Bank has acknowledged
