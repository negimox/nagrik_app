# Infrastructure AI Maintenance Management

This document describes the maintenance management capabilities that have been added to the report dashboard application.

## 🔧 Maintenance Management System

### Overview

The maintenance management system extends our AI-powered infrastructure issue detection by adding scheduling and tracking capabilities. This allows maintenance teams to efficiently plan and execute repairs for detected issues.

### Key Features

1. **AI-Integrated Scheduling**

   - Schedule maintenance directly based on AI-detected issues
   - Automatically suggests priority levels based on AI severity assessment
   - Pre-fills issue details and descriptions from AI analysis

2. **Comprehensive Calendar View**

   - Visual calendar display of scheduled maintenance
   - Date-based filtering of maintenance tasks
   - Color-coded status and priority indicators

3. **Maintenance Workflow Management**
   - Track the complete lifecycle of infrastructure repairs
   - Update status from scheduled → in-progress → completed
   - View maintenance statistics and urgent issue counts

## 📱 New Components

### 1. Maintenance Scheduler

The `MaintenanceScheduler` component provides a form-based interface for scheduling maintenance:

```typescript
interface MaintenanceSchedule {
  issue: string;
  date: Date | undefined;
  timeSlot: string;
  crew: string;
  priority: "urgent" | "high" | "medium" | "low";
  notes: string;
  estimatedDuration: string;
  status: "scheduled" | "in-progress" | "completed" | "cancelled";
}
```

Key capabilities:

- Date and time selection
- Maintenance crew assignment
- Priority level setting (with AI-suggested defaults)
- Duration estimation
- Notes and instructions field

### 2. Maintenance Schedule View

The `MaintenanceScheduleView` component provides a calendar-based visualization:

- Interactive calendar with marked maintenance dates
- Filtered view of tasks for selected dates
- Status update functionality
- Color-coded priority indicators
- Detailed maintenance information display

### 3. Maintenance Management Page

The new `/citizen/maintenance` page integrates all components:

- Issue detection with AI analysis
- Scheduling interface for detected issues
- Calendar view of all maintenance tasks
- Status dashboard with maintenance statistics
- Complete workflow from detection to completion

## 🔄 Integration with AI Detection

The maintenance system is deeply integrated with our Google Gemini AI detection:

1. AI detects issues and determines severity
2. User selects an issue to schedule maintenance
3. Scheduler pre-fills issue details and suggests priority
4. Maintenance is scheduled and appears in calendar
5. Status updates track the progress of repairs

## 📊 Maintenance Analytics

The system provides basic analytics on the maintenance dashboard:

- Number of scheduled tasks
- Tasks currently in progress
- Completed maintenance count
- Number of urgent issues requiring attention

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

The maintenance system uses these key components:

- React state for managing maintenance data
- Date-fns library for date handling and formatting
- Shadcn/UI components for consistent interface
- Context integration with the image detection system

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Planned future improvements to the maintenance system include:

1. Integration with work order systems
2. Mobile notifications for maintenance crews
3. Historical tracking and reporting of maintenance efficiency
4. Cost estimation and resource planning tools
5. Integration with inventory management for parts and supplies
