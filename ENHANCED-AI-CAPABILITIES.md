# Enhanced Google Gemini AI Infrastructure Analysis

This document explains the improvements made to the AI image detection system for infrastructure issue reporting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced AI Capabilities

### 1. Improved Object Detection & Analysis

The Google Gemini integration has been enhanced to go beyond simple object detection. The system now:

- **Identifies infrastructure issues** (potholes, broken streetlights, etc.)
- **Assesses damage conditions** (broken, cracked, leaking, etc.)
- **Provides detailed descriptions** of the issues detected
- **Determines severity levels** (Low, Medium, High)

### 2. Enhanced Data Model

The `DetectedObject` type has been upgraded to `EnhancedDetectedObject`:

```typescript
export interface EnhancedDetectedObject {
  name: string;
  confidence: number;
  condition?: string; // NEW: State of the object (broken, damaged, etc.)
  description?: string; // NEW: Detailed description of the issue
  severity?: "Low" | "Medium" | "High"; // NEW: Urgency/danger classification
}
```

### 3. Automatic Form Population

The report submission form now gets populated with more accurate information:

- **Report titles** include the condition of the infrastructure
- **Descriptions** use AI-generated detailed explanations when available
- **Severity levels** are directly derived from AI assessment

## üöÄ New AI-Powered Demos

### Infrastructure AI Demo

A dedicated demo page has been created at `/citizen/infrastructure-ai-demo` that showcases:

- Real-time AI analysis of infrastructure issues
- Visual display of detected problems with severity indicators
- Detailed assessment of conditions and recommended actions
- Raw data examination for transparency

### Original Image Detection Demo

The existing demo at `/citizen/image-detection-demo` remains available with the enhanced AI capabilities.

## üí° How to Use

1. Upload or capture an image of an infrastructure issue
2. The AI will analyze the image and provide detailed information
3. Review the detected issues, their conditions, and severity levels
4. Create a report with the pre-filled information or adjust as needed

## üîß Implementation Details

### AI Prompt Engineering

The integration uses an improved prompt for Google Gemini:

```
Analyze this image and identify infrastructure or civic issues (like potholes, broken streetlights, garbage, damaged facilities).
For each issue detected, return a JSON array with objects containing:
1) "name" (what the object is)
2) "confidence" (number between 0-100)
3) "condition" (describe the condition - e.g. "broken", "damaged", "overflowing")
4) "description" (2-3 sentence detailed description of the issue)
5) "severity" (must be exactly "Low", "Medium", or "High" based on danger level and urgency)
```

### Component Updates

- `ReportContext` now uses the enhanced object type
- `ImageDetector` displays the extended information in a more structured format
- `Report` page uses the AI-provided descriptions and severity directly

## üìã Future Improvements

- Add historical comparison to track infrastructure degradation over time
- Integrate with maintenance crew scheduling systems
- Add specialized models for different types of infrastructure
