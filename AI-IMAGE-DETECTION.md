# Google Gemini AI Image Detection Integration

This update integrates Google's Gemini AI image recognition capabilities into the image-detector component of the report dashboard application.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Utilities File

Created a new utilities file (`lib/genai-utils.ts`) that handles all Google Gemini AI interactions, which includes:

- Setting up the GenAI client
- Image processing and resizing functions
- AI content generation with proper error handling

### 2. Updated Image Detector Component

The `image-detector.tsx` component has been modified to:

- Use real AI-based detection instead of hardcoded values
- Support both file upload and camera-based photo capture
- Properly handle loading states and errors
- Display detected objects with confidence scores

### 3. Camera Functionality

Added proper camera support for mobile devices:

- Captures photos using the device camera
- Processes them through Gemini AI
- Shows real-time feedback

### 4. Demo Page

Created a demo page at `/citizen/image-detection-demo` to showcase the AI image detection capabilities.

## How to Test

1. Run the application with `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to `/citizen/image-detection-demo`
3. Upload an image or take a photo with the camera
4. See the AI detection results displayed on the right side

## Technical Implementation

The updated component:

1. Takes an image from either file upload or camera
2. Resizes and processes it to optimize for AI analysis
3. Sends it to Google's Gemini AI API
4. Parses the returned JSON response
5. Updates the UI with the detected objects and confidence scores

## Environment Variables

Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in your `.env.local` file.

## Usage in Reports

The detected objects are stored in the `imageData.detectedObjects` array in the `ReportContext`, and can be used to auto-fill form fields based on the AI's analysis of the image content.
